# Exercise-Pass-Tests-with-Typescript-and-Jasmine
This project is already configured to work with TypeScript and Jasmine.

Your task is to write at least one spec per function used on the index.ts file. There should be at least 7 specs. You must use at least 5 different matchers for your tests. All of your specs can be on 1 spec file.

Make sure to build your TypeScript project and make certain all of your tests pass. Check the package.json file to view scripts available.

NOTE: a popup of "Renderer Failure: tsconfig.json" may open when starting this project. It is safe to ignore this error. Error is due to the comments in tsconfig.json not being considered valid JSON; however, it is generally considered safe to place comments in JSON config files.
